# HDB-Resale-Prices
Topic: Predictive Modelling for HDB Resale Prices (2023) Using R

Objective: The objective of this project was to come up with a prediction model that uses backdated data from the HDB website to estimate HDB Resale Prices for the town of Punggol in Singapore using R. This model provides a reliable framework in accessing and predicting housing prices especially in the context of Singapore.

Methods Used: Machine Learning technicalities such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Regularization were employed in the process. 

Remarks: The attached PDF provides a deeper insight into the context of the project and the steps that were taken for us to derive at a statistically validated conclusion. The project as awarded with a High Distinction grade.
